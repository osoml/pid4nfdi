      subtitle: What Data is Collected and How It is Used
      text: |
        The complete and full legal text of the privacy policy, which is legally authoritative, can be found below.
        
        Here's an overview of the most important aspects of possible collection and use of personal data when you visit and use this website:
        * **Website hosting via GitHub**: The website is hosted via GitHub, using a service called GitHub Pages. GitHub records information (server logs, including IP addresses (which can be used to infer location), date and time of page loads, pages accessed, referring sites or pages, page visits (number of times a specific site was visited). GitHub may also collect information about the type of device and web browser used to visit the website (as provided by every standard web browser) and GitHub may collect geolocation information beyond the IP address (e.g. if you allow your browser and/or device to share this information). GitHub uses this data for various purposes, including improving service performance and security, analyzing the use of their services, personalizing user experience, complying with legal obligations. More information, including your rights, can be found in [GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement). You can check out the [GitHub repository for this website directly on github.com](https://github.com/base4nfdi/pid4nfdi/).
        * **GDPR-compliant web analytics via Matomo**: To help us continuously improve our website and understand how people use it, we use a privacy-focused analytics tool called Matomo. Most important, the tool collects basic usage data anonymously, so no personal data is collected (no cookies are used and no full IP addresses are stored). The data collected includes the subpages you visit, how long you stay, and the type of device and web browser you use (as provided by every standard web browser).  If you have the _Do Not Track_ feature enabled in your browser settings, no data is collected by the tool at all. The website uses the Matomo service from – and therefore makes connections to – the University of Bielefeld (uni-bielefeld.de).
        * **Contacting us via our contact form**: If you use our [contact form](/about/contact/) to contact us, the information you entered into the form is sent to a ticket system with which we manage inquiries, very similar to an email which you sent which is then received by the email server of the recipient. The ticket system is operated by the Technical University of Darmstadt.
        * **Third-party services for website functionality**: The website includes content from – and therefore makes connections to – the services Netlify (netlify.com) and JSDelivr (jsdelivr.net) to include JavaScript and CSS libraries used for some features and the design of the website. No cookies of these services are used.
        
        You, the user, have the right to access, correct, and request the deletion of any personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Please refer to the respective sections in the full privacy policy below.

        ### Understanding Our Third Party Processing and Your Privacy
        To ensure the proper functioning of our website, user engagement tracking, and content delivery, we work with external service providers for data processing tasks. These providers may collect and analyse user data, such as IP addresses, browser information, and access logs, in compliance with data protection regulations. For example, this data may be used to host the website, monitor user interactions, and gather statistics on page visits or content engagement. All third-party data processing is done transparently, and we implement contracts to ensure that data processing complies with GDPR requirements. The external data processing services are listed below with explanations/examples:
        
        #### Contact via Email
        Our website provides the option to reach out to our project team or specific team members via email. Depending on the team, you may contact them via their personal email addresses or through a dedicated mailing list. If you choose to contact us through these email addresses or mailing lists, we will collect and process your personal data, such as your name and email address, solely to manage your inquiry or request. This processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1e) of the GDPR, which allows us to process personal data to respond to your communication effectively. Please note that some teams may use multiple mailing list services or email programs to manage communications, and your data will only be used for the inquiry, not shared beyond that.
        
        #### Web Analytics via Matomo (de.NBI)
        We use Matomo, an open-source web analytics software, to analyse the usage of our website and improve its content. This section explains how we collect and process anonymised usage statistics through Matomo, ensuring that your privacy is protected.
